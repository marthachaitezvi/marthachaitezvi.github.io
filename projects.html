                        <p> Designed and analyzed a 703W horizontal axis wind turbine for installation at Ashesi University. Incorporated control-volume analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and prototype-testing methodologies. Utilized Bernoulli's equation and momentum conservation to optimize turbine efficiency, determining key parameters including rotor diameter, blade length, and power coefficient. Conducted CFD simulations to visualize velocity and pressure distributions around the airfoil. Developed a scaled prototype for wind tunnel testing to investigate the relationship between Reynolds number and drag coefficient, with plans to validate numerical predictions through wake visualization and force measurements. This project demonstrated a comprehensive application of fluid mechanics principles to renewable energy design.</p>

                        <p>This study investigated the effect of calcium chloride crosslinking concentration on the chemical and mechanical properties of alginate-based hydrogels for agricultural water retention applications. Controlled laboratory experiments were conducted. Hydrogel performance was evaluated through water absorption, release, retention, and mechanical testing, with statistical analysis using ANOVA, Tukey post hoc tests, and regression analysis. Results showed that increasing crosslinking reduced water absorption but improved retention and mechanical strength, with 3% crosslinking identified as the optimal balance. The findings highlight the potential of hydrogel optimization for water-scarce agricultural contexts.</p>

                        <p>Led a team research project, developing a comprehensive SEIR  mathematical model to analyze Ebola transmission dynamics in West African populations. Implemented an 18-equation differential equation system incorporating population dynamics, vaccination status, condom usage, quarantine, and treatment interventions to simulate disease spread mechanisms. Conducted sensitivity analysis on critical behavioral parameters, examining how condom usage rates, vaccination compliance, and unvaccinated population protection influence exposure and infection rates across susceptible populations. Identified key findings demonstrating that higher condom adoption among vaccinated individuals reduces the exposed populations. Discovered unexpected interactions in the parameter space, revealing complex interdependencies in disease transmission, suggesting that protective behaviors have non-linear effects on population exposure. Modeled scenarios ranging from baseline transmission (zero intervention) to ideal conditions (universal condom use), providing quantitative evidence for public health policy recommendations in epidemic control strategies.</p>

                        <p>Designed and engineered a motorized aluminum can crusher to improve recycling efficiency, applying advanced mechanical design principles. Developed a double crank mechanism driven by an electric motor via V-belt drive, generating 500 N crushing force over a 50 mm stroke to reduce can volume by 80%. Performed shaft, bearing, and pulley design, and conducted finite element analysis (FEA) on the piston and slider, achieving a factor of safety of 1.1×10³ and a very small damage factor. Validated performance through functional testing on multiple can sizes and ensured portability and user-friendliness. Produced a detailed bill of materials and maintenance schedule, delivering a cost-effective, reliable solution for household and small-business aluminium can recycling</p>
