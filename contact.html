                        <p>As a Research Intern at Ashesi University, I led an independent capstone project focused on developing a low-cost, microfluidic-based tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic device tailored for HIV co-infected patients in low-resource settings. My work involved end-to-end research design, from literature review and concept development to laboratory experimentation and device prototyping. I collaborated closely with the Provost’s Office and faculty across disciplines, supporting multiple research initiatives through structured literature analysis and experimental planning. In the university biolab, I conducted hands-on laboratory research centered on assay development, aptamer integration, and iterative prototyping of diagnostic platforms.</p>

                        <p>In my role as a Faculty Intern, I support teaching and learning for undergraduate engineering students through facilitation, mentorship, and curriculum development. I have guided 64 first-year engineering students by leading instructional sessions, responding to technical questions, and supporting project-based learning activities. Additionally, I mentored 10 students in Synthetic Biology, assisting them in experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication. I work alongside faculty to co-develop curriculum modules that strengthen interactive learning, problem-based exercises, and effective assessment strategies.</p>

                        <p>As a Content Development Intern, I contributed to expanding access to practical STEM education by developing and publishing over 200 hands-on science activities for educational manuals used in low-income schools in Ghana and Liberia. I tested and refined more than 100 of these activities with 30 students, incorporating feedback to optimize clarity, engagement, and learning outcomes. I also co-authored more than five educational manuals, contributing low-resource experimental designs and receiving credited authorship for my work.</p>

                        <p>I founded ProGeneBio, a biotechnology startup dedicated to the local production of diagnostic enzymes to improve access for research laboratories, hospitals, and educational institutions across Africa. Through this venture, I conducted market research and stakeholder interviews to identify critical gaps in enzyme availability and supply chains within Ghana. I have led the design and early-stage prototyping of cost-effective enzyme manufacturing workflows, including OpenVent and other enzymes essential for molecular diagnostics, with a focus on affordability, scalability, and local capacity building.</p>
